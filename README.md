OAWire aims to provide browser plugins for a web based [OpenArena](http://openarena.ws) gaming experience. Currently there is only a Firefox addon with a very limited set of features. The aim is to support more browsers and add more features.

The Firefox addon can also be found in the [Mozilla Addons repository](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/oawire/).

Current features:
  * Creates launcher buttons on the [dpmaster](http://dpmaster.deathmask.net/?game=openarena) site and converts every OACON link
  * Possibility of additional launching arguments
  * Full localization support (see [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/oawire/wiki/Localization) for more details)
