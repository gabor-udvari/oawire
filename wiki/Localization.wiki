Just translate the following lines and send me an e-mail with them to the gabor.udvari@gmail.com address. You will be credited for your hard work. You will be asked to be the maintainer for the language, so please consider that before and if you're ready to accept that, include your e-mail address where I can reach you if the strings change.
